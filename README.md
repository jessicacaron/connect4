## Project Description:
Gameplay:
Users take turns one at a time clicking on the connect 4 board trying to get 4 in a row. Screen displays the users turn and after the game is won, it prompts for users name to enter into the high scores page.

## Time to complete:
 2 Weeks

## Challenges:
For this project, the game logic was relatively simple. It was difficult to get the board to respond to a click anywhere on the board and put the game peice in the correct location. I used a helper function to check current board and assigned it to each of the rows of the board. I also wanted the game board to resemble the classic game, so I spent time working with CSS to get each of the squares to display properly and with the correct color game piece. This was completed by alternating css styles as needed.
